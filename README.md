# Machine-Learning using Python

A set of python scripts using scikit-learn for simple machine learning applications. 

1. Simple_gender_classification.py

This script compares and predicts the most accurate model among different existing supervised learning models like (Decision Tree, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gaussian NB, Support Vector Machines and K Neighbors) on a data set consisting of two variables, one containing the list of height, weight and shoe size, and the other containing respective gender. 

Dependencies: 
1. scikit-learn
2. numpy
3. scipy
